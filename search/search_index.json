enabling both Controllers and Pilots to enjoy themselves with a standardized and realistic service. This project is entirely open-source, relying on Community contributions and support to help makes these the best they can be. You don't need to have an in-depth knowledge of programming languages to contribute to the project, as most of our pages are written in Markdown . Everything else will be explained as we go. What are we looking for? On VATSIM, we have to draw the line between what's hyper-realistic and the practical limitations of the network. People use VATSIM for a wide range of reasons - some seek a realistic service, whereas some people might just want to add an extra dimension to an already enjoyable hobby. When contributing to these SOPs , it's important to keep this in mind and to cater to everybody on the network. We draw the line at things like low-visibilty and noise-abatement operations - where there offer no real benefit in the virtual environment. In contrast, procedures for Code F aircraft should be added, as these can have an effect on Pilots and their aircraft. Before you dig in. It's important that you read all of the Contribution documentation before making any changes. These will ensure that your PR's are approved and merged quickly. Additionally, we ask that you reach out to the ATS Team before opening a new PR for your addition.

This page should give you an indication of how to properly set up an individual page or category. We'll go through the motions of setting up a new category, which will take you through most of the things needed. Starting a new Category or subdirectory Let's say we want to create a new 'Military' category, here's the category setup we'd want: Main Directory / docs/ military / .pages index.md buzzandbreak.md formationflying.md .pages Within the main docs/ directory, create the new folder. The name of the folder will also be what's shown in the URL string - in this case it'll be website.xyz/military/ . Within that directory, you can see a few files. The files ending in .md are singular pages and follow the normal page conventions. The .pages file is a MkDocs specific file that tells MkDocs how to render the navigation elements. We'll touch base on that later. Single Page Every page starts the same way - with a title declaration and an abbreviation include. --- title: Building Blocks --- --8<-- \"includes/abbreviations.md\" The title declaration block is sets the title across a few different areas. It automatically appears at the top of the page as an h1 element, and will show in all website navigation unless overwritten by a .pages file. The --8<-- \"includes/abbreviations.md\" line pulls in the abbreviations file. This pulls in defined abbreviations, and allows for these to be shown all across the site. Hint Since the title attribute can be seen across multiple areas, so it's important that it's both short and descriptive. If the page is nested within another category, you should be able to rely on context. For example, this page is called Building Blocks . This could mean Lego, but since it's in the Assist Us section, you would be fair to assume that it contains the building blocks of a page. .pages file As eluded to before, the .pages file is a tells MkDocs how to render the navigation elements. title: Military nav: - \"Overview\": index.md - \"Buzz and Break\": buzzandbreak.md - formationflying.md - ...

This doesn't change how the category is processed, only displayed. Breakdown: nav: - Dictates how items are shown, and in what order. This is mandatory. \"Overview\": index.md - \"Overview\" is a manually set title, and overrides any titles defined locally within the page itself.

When your working on these SOPs , we require you to create a new branch, that we can then merge into main . So how do we contribute a new item or section? Let's have a look! Fork the project into your personal account on GitHub. Create a new branch from main , with a clear name of what you're implementing - seen in the image on the right. Checkout your new branch, and commit some changes. Open a new Pull Request for your changes/branch. This can be done by heading to the sops repository, and finding Pull requests Click on the green button, saying New pull request Make note of the arrow! In the image to the left, you can see that the arrow shows that we're wanting to merge this-is-a-test-branch into main . After making sure the arrows are correct, click on the green Create pull request button. Make sure your title clearly explains the changes you've made, but is still concise. Fill out the main content of your PR as necessary. The main content of your PR serves as the project tracker for that feature or fix. Feel free to add in checkboxes of important steps, or whatever you need. Other people are also able to make changes to your branch, and may occasionally have some discussion on your PR.

In the real world, there are many reasons why an alternate may need to be carried. This page simplifies some of the real world rules and highlights the ones which are applicable for VATSIM operations. Any alternate you nominate must not, itself, require an alternate. Alternate due Weather When planning a flight, make careful study of your destination's TAF and take note of the cloud, visibility, and wind during the period of 30 minutes either side of your ETA (60 minute window). Compare the forecast values with the alternate minima described below. If a TAF is not available for your arrival window, you must hold an alternate. You must plan an alternate (or carry sufficient holding fuel, see Fuel Planning ) if: There is more than scattered cloud below the alternate minima, or The visibility is less than the alternate minima, or The wind (including any gusts) exceed the aircraft's crosswind or tailwind limitations, or The forecast indicates thunderstorms or their associated severe turbulence Note When calculating the amount of cloud at a given level, the following rules apply: FEW plus FEW equals SCT FEW plus SCT equals BKN Tip You can access TAFs and METARs for your departure & destination airports (as well as all available charts) using VATPAC's Pilot Assist tool. VFR Alternate Minima The VFR alternate minima, by both day and night, is as follows: Cloud Visibility 1,500ft AGL 8km For helicopters operated under Day VFR to an uncontrolled (Class G) aerodrome, the alternate minima is reduced to: Cloud Visibility 1,000ft AGL 3km Note An alternate is not required if you are flying under Day VFR and plan to remain within 50nm of the departure aerodrome. IFR Alternate Minima The IFR alternate minima is described on any approach chart for that aerodrome. The figures are formatted as cloud height above ground level and visibility in kilometres. Example An alternate would be required for a Category C aircraft landing at Adelaide (YPAD) with more than scattered cloud below 1,480ft AGL and/or visibility below 6.0km . Adelaide Alternate Minima (example only, not for operational use) Note See Aircraft Categories below to determine your aircraft's category. If your destination does not have an instrument approach, you must plan an alternate if the forecast indicates weather conditions below: Cloud Visibility LSALT +500ft 8km Alterante due Navaids IFR An alternate must be held for IFR flights if due to the aircraft's equipment or the destination aerodrome's navigation aids, a single point of failure in the aircraft or on the ground would cause a loss of approach capability. In practice, this means that if your destination has only a single approach type available or your aircraft has only a single piece of equipment which can receive that data, you must carry an alternate. Example Flying a King Air (with a single GNSS , and multiple VHF NAV & ADF equipment onboard) to Orange (YORG), which has published RNP approaches but no ground based aids, would require an alternate, as a loss of RAIM or GNSS integrity would result in the aircraft being unable to conduct an approach. Flying a C172 (with a single GNSS and a single VHF NAV) to Sydney (YSSY) would not require an alternate, as a failure of a single piece of equipment in the aircraft (e.g. the GPS) or on the ground (e.g. the ILS ) would not prevent the aircraft from conducting an approach (they could still utilise the RNP or ILS approach, depending on the source of failure).

The sections below outline the categories of fuel which may be required. A sample fuel plan is included to highlight the practical use of each fuel category. Flight/Trip Fuel Flight fuel (also called Trip Fuel) is the amount of fuel you expect to burn to fly your planned route, including an allowance for climb and descent if required. It is generally calculated by dividing your route distance by your expected ground speed (accounting for forecast wind). Reserve Fuel Reserve fuel is an allowance which helps cater for anything which may increase the flight fuel (such as unforecast headwinds) and provides a safety margin in case an unexpected event results in a fuel emergency. It is broken up into Final Reserve fuel and Contingency fuel. In the real world, reserve fuel rules are divided into aircraft category and weight class. The following table simplifies these rules for VATSIM use. Aircraft Type Flight Rules Final Reserve Contingency Fuel Piston engine or small turboprop Day VFR 30 min Piston engine or small turboprop Night VFR or IFR 45 min Jet engine or commuter turboprop VFR or IFR 30 min 5% of flight & alternate fuel Helicopter VFR 20 min Helicopter IFR 30 min Contingency fuel is designed to be used, to cater for unexpected headwinds, unusual fuel burns, or other small factors which may impact overall fuel usage. Final Reserve fuel is designed as a safety buffer and should not be used. It is a requirement that you land with your Final Reserve fuel intact. See Inflight Fuel Emergencies for what is required when you expect to have to use your Final Reserve fuel. Taxi Fuel Taxi fuel is required to cater for the fuel required to taxi to the runway for departure, and to the gate after landing. It may also include a fuel allowance to run the APU. The actual burn rate will depend on the aircraft. Instrument Approach Fuel Instrument approaches often involve configuring the aircraft earlier than normal and tracking via points not planned to originally. As such, extra fuel must be carried when an instrument approach is expected. The exact amount of fuel depends on the aircraft you are flying, but as a general rule of thumb, allowing 10-15 min at the normal burn rate is normally sufficient. Approach fuel is only required when the weather indicates an instrument approach will be required to land. This is generally indicated by the following meteorological minima: Cloud Visibility Any cloud below LSALT +500ft Less than 8km Weather Holding/Alternate Fuel Where the weather (or other factors) are expected to be unsuitable, sufficient fuel must be carried to either hold until conditions improve or divert to a suitable alternate aerodrome. See Alternate Requirements for more information. If the weather is forecast to be below the alternate minima, an alternate must be carried. If the poor weather is associated with an INTER or TEMPO , holding fuel must be carried to wait until conditions improve, in accordance with the table below. Term Description Holding Fuel Required INTER Intermittent period lasting up to 30 minutes 30 min TEMPO Temporary period lasting up to 60 minutes 60 min If a forecast indicates a probability ( PROB30 or PROB40 ) of poor weather below the alternate minima, you must assume that the weather will eventuate, and hold an alternate or carry holding fuel as required. Example Alternate minima : cloud base of 1,200ft and visibility of 5km TAF (snippet) : PROB30 INTER 0312/0318 4000 SHOWERS OF MODERATE RAIN BKN010 Fuel Required : 30 min weather holding fuel (if ETA falls between 1130z and 1830z) Traffic Holding Fuel Traffic holding fuel is required when operating into certain busy aerodromes. In the real world, traffic levels are consistent and planned, whereas on VATSIM, traffic levels are variable and often unpredictable. Real world traffic holding requirements are found in an aerodrome's ERSA FAC entry. On VATSIM, it is more important to carry traffic holding fuel during busy events. Regular events, like Milk Run Monday, Panic Stations, and WorldFlight, where high traffic levels are expected, require additional holding fuel to cater for enroute delaying action (such as vectors, holds, and extended periods of time at lower altitudes). The amount of fuel required is left up to the pilot, but as a general rule, regular events like Milk Run Monday require roughly 20 min of holding fuel, whereas more renowned events like WorldFlight may require up to 90 min. If in doubt, carry a little extra. Extra Fuel The pilot in command may dictate any extra fuel they wish to carry and it is their responsibility to ensure that the fuel onboard is sufficient to complete the flight. If you believe that extra fuel is required for any reason, you must carry that fuel. There are other situations where you may wish to carry extra fuel, including fuel tankering (carrying enough fuel for the return leg) or when flying to an isolated aerodrome with minimal suitable divert points. It is also worth remembering that you will be sharing the airspace with pilots of all competency levels, which may result in unexpected go arounds or approaches, so extra fuel may be required to compensate. Example Fuel Plan Below are several sample fuel plans for various aircraft types. These are provided as an example of how to utilise each category of fuel described above. The burn rates and described fuel figures are examples only and should not be used in an operational sense. Example Aircraft : Cessna 172 Flight Rules : VFR Route : YSBK PRT PENH HSY LRF HBB SYHD JIBN SECF APPN CAMB TWRN YSBK Route Distance : 102 nm Estimated Enroute Time : 56 min Planned Burn Rate : 36 L/hr Destination Weather : Clear skies, calm winds Additional Notes : Harbour Scenic One planned, extra fuel carried in case of holding Category Amount Flight Fuel 34 L Alternate Fuel Weather Holding Traffic Holding Instrument Approach Final Reserve 18 L Contingency Fuel Taxi Fuel 5 L Extra Fuel 12 L (20 min holding) Total Fuel Required 69 L Example Aircraft : SAAB 340 Flight Rules : IFR Route : YGTH BORLI V300 AKMIR W113 TESAT YSSY Route Distance : 256 nm Estimated Enroute Time : 57 min Planned Burn Rate : 500 kg/hr Holding Burn Rate : 450 kg/hr Destination Weather : Consistent weather below the alternate minima, Canberra (YSCB) nominated as destination alternate Additional Notes : Flight conducted during Milk Run Monday event Category Amount Flight Fuel 475 kg Alternate Fuel 257 kg Weather Holding Traffic Holding 150 kg (20 min) Instrument Approach 200 kg (2 approaches) Final Reserve 225 kg Contingency Fuel 37 kg Taxi Fuel 25 kg Extra Fuel Total Fuel Required 1,369 kg Inflight Diversion Some situations, such as heavy traffic, thunderstorms, or mechanical failure, may result in extended holding at your destination. In these cases, an inflight fuel plan should be done to determine the minimum amount of fuel required to divert to a suitable alternate (either nominated during preflight planning or determined then and there). Once a suitable alternate has been found, determine the flight fuel required to get there, any weather, traffic, or other holding requirements it may have, whether an approach will be required, and any other fuel you may need. Add your required reserves to determine your calculated minimum fuel, then apply a conservative buffer. By assessing your current fuel state and actual burn rate, you can determine how much time you have remaining in the hold before you must divert. It is important to keep ATC in the loop when approaching your divert time and ensure you start tracking for your alternate without delay. If your fuel state deteriorates further, you may need to advise ATC as per Inflight Fuel Emergencies below. Example Aircraft : SAAB 340 Flight Rules : IFR Alternate Weather : Good, with an INTER below the alternate minima Category Amount Flight Fuel to Alternate 219 kg Final Reserve 225 kg Contingency Fuel 22 kg Weather Holding 225 kg (30 min) Traffic Holding Instrument Approach Extra Fuel Total Fuel Required 691 kg Minimum Fuel with Buffer 750 kg Fuel Onboard : 1,050 kg Current Fuel Burn : 350 kg/hr The aircraft can remain in the hold for another 51 minutes before a diversion becomes necessary. Inflight Fuel Emergencies As explained in Reserve Fuel , you are required to land with your Final Reserve fuel intact (untouched). During the course of normal operations, this should not be a problem. If, through poor planning or unexpected enroute delays, you are expecting to land with less than your Final Reserve fuel onboard, you must notify ATC, as per below. See Radio Telephony - Emergency for notes on how to communicate these emergencies over the radio. Minimum Fuel You must declare MINIMUM FUEL to ATC when you are informed of a delay which will result in you using all of the holding fuel you have onboard. This means that the current delay will not result in you landing with less than your Final Reserve fuel onboard, but any additional delay will. In response to a declaration of MINIMUM FUEL, you will not receive any priority from ATC, however you will be informed of any expected additional delay. Mayday Fuel You must declare MAYDAY FUEL when you determine that you will be landing with less than your Fixed Reserve onboard. The declaration of MAYDAY FUEL constitutes an emergency and you will receive priority from ATC to enable you to land as soon as possible.","title":"Fuel Planning"},{"location":"flight-planning/fuelplanning/#preflight-fuel-planning","text":"Before departing, it is critical that you ensure the fuel on board is sufficient for your intended flight, including any required reserve or holding fuel.

However, if you are planning to enter CTA or visit a major aerodrome, careful route selection will make it considerably easier for ATC to clear you as requested. A number of third-party tools exist to help with route selection but each have shortcomings and limitations, so it's helpful to be aware of how to perform this task manually. VFR Route Selection When operating VFR , you are required to determine your position with a visual fix every 30 minutes (see VFR Navigation for more info), so it is important that you plan your route with enough identifiable landmarks to allow frequent visual fixes. Using a VTC , VNC , or WAC (available on the AIP website), plot your departure and destination airports, then assess any route requirements to remain clear of obstacles, CTA , or PRDs . From there, select a route which will provide easy visual navigation, with frequent landmarks (such as mountain peaks, lakes, river junctions, towns, racetracks, etc) on and either side of your planned track. When operating near CTA or PRDs , apply a conservative lateral buffer or plan a level which remains clear of the boundary. If ATC see you tracking towards airspace without a clearance, they're likely to send you a 'contact me' request. If you plan to enter or transit CTA , especially around major Class C aerodromes, plan a backup route which remains OCTA , in case an airways clearance is unavailable. IFR Route Selection IFR flights are generally planned along pre-defined airways, joining ground-based navaids or RNAV waypoints together along surveyed paths. This provides pilots with terrain/obstacle clearance assurance and helps manage traffic in busy terminal areas by defining a designated inbound and outbound track. Some airways are designated as one-way tracks, while others allow traffic to utilise it in both directions. Pilots should use an ERC in conjunction with a TAC around major aerodromes to determine the best route. For operations at or below FL200, use the ERC -L (low). Operations above FL200 should use the ERC -H (high). Some remote aerodromes aren't serviced by airways, so it may be desirable to plan direct to an appropriate fix instead. When planning a route, consider any airspace requirements (particularly when operating to, from, or in the vicinity of major aerodromes) and ensure you comply with the ERSA Flight Planning Requirements as detailed below. Also consider the terrain you'll be flying over. During the winter months, icing can become a serious threat to aircraft without ice protection equipment and an alternate route may need to be planned to avoid areas of high terrain, allowing the aircraft to operate in the warmer air at lower altitudes. Each degree of latitude/longitude on an ERC -L is divided into a grid, and a Grid LSALT is published for each square denoting the lowest safe altitude for operations in that area. Pilots can use these Grid LSALTs to ensure they'll remain above any limiting obstacles/terrain, even if they need to deviate off their planned route. ERSA Flight Planning Requirements The ERSA Flight Planning Requirements (FPR) document lists required tracking points and vertical restrictions which help manage traffic flow into and out of busy aerodromes. Ensure that your planned route complies with any restrictions imposed by the FPR. If your planned departure and destination aerodrome (or initial tracking points) are not listed in the document, you can assume that no planning requirements apply. In this case, plan a route in accordance with the advice above to respect any one-way airways or other planning requirements. Tip If the required route listed in the FPR is undesirable (e.g. it adds significant track miles) and the weather is suitable, consider departing VFR or remaining OCTA until you are outside the terminal area. Altitude Selection Appropriate level selection depends on your flight rules, route, and intention to enter or remain clear of CTA . For IFR , determine the highest LSALT out of the airways you've selected or the Grid LSALT , if not flying via airways for your entire route. For VFR , identify the highest obstacles/terrain and select a level which provides a safe buffer (generally 500ft, or 1000ft if above a populated area) above. Grid LSALTs (circled) over Flinders Island for each green grid square Next, adjust your chosen level to comply with the hemispherical level rule. IFR flights should plan an odd level (e.g. 7,000ft) when flying east and an even level (e.g. 8,000ft) when flying west, up to 41,000ft. VFR flights should comply with this rule, but add 500ft to the determined level. A full list of available altitudes is replicated below: IFR - Track 000 to 179 IFR - Track 180 to 359 3,000ft 2,000ft 5,000ft 4,000ft 7,000ft 6,000ft 9,000ft 8,000ft FL110 10,000ft FL130 FL120 FL150 FL140 FL170 FL160 FL190 FL180 FL210 FL200 FL230 FL220 FL250 FL240 FL270 FL260 FL290 FL280 FL310 FL300 FL330 FL320 FL350 FL340 FL370 FL360 FL390 FL380 FL410 FL400 FL450 FL430 FL490 FL470 FL510 VFR - Track 000 to 179 VFR - Track 180 to 359 3,500ft 2,500ft 5,500ft 4,500ft 7,500ft 6,500ft 9,500ft 8,500ft FL115 10,500ft FL135 FL125 FL155 FL145 FL175 FL165 FL195 FL185 FL215 FL205 FL235 FL225 FL245 Note When planning to operate VFR outside CTA at 3,000ft AMSL or below, you may select any desired altitude without regard for the table above. Tip These rules apply to pilots at the flight planning stage. Once airborne, you may request climb to non-standard levels, subject to surrounding traffic and ATC requirements. Use of Third-Party Tools Flight planning can be greatly simplified through the use of the many available third-party tools, although caution should be taken when utilising them. SimBrief is a popular site designed to automate route selection and fuel planning. Pay extra attention when selecting a route from the suggested list, as they may have been submitted by users with little flight planning experience. It is good practice to confidence check the suggested route against another source, and where available, select the purple 'Preferred Route' (which have been uploaded by VATPAC staff). It is also recommended that you add extra fuel (using the built-in input boxes) where required, as per Fuel Planning . VATPAC's Pilot Assist tool can be helpful for generating weather forecasts and accessing charts for your planned flight. The system can also be used to generate a route which complies with the ERSA FPR. Some aerodromes and terminal areas feature specific procedures for pilots to comply with. These procedures have been summarised in Local Procedures , where you'll find flight planning advice as well as in-flight procedural guidelines. Applications like Navigraph allow pilots to plot out their intended flight plan on appropriate maps and charts. For those without a subscription, the free SkyVector provides similar functionality. Be aware that the system is primarily designed for use in the USA and whilst Australian coverage is generally good, the VFR mapping system is lacking compared to other options.","title":"Route Selection"},{"location":"flight-planning/routeselection/#vfr-route-selection","text":"When operating VFR , you are required to determine your position with a visual fix every 30 minutes (see VFR Navigation for more info), so it is important that you plan your route with enough identifiable landmarks to allow frequent visual fixes.
